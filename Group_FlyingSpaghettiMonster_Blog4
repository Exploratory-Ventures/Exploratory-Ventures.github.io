 "Maybe we shouldn't have ordered from banggood.com" an insightful quote by Sam Silver.
"GitHub Can GetOut!" a famous anonymous quote
     This week our group began working on our physical quadcopter. We recently received our quadcopter blades, which we were very disappointed with. Although the quadcopter blades were not as large or as sturdy as we would have liked them, we quickly ordered new carbon fiber blades, which we quickly received  through amazon prime. We immediately began testing our new carbon fiber blades, however we were disappointed with the speed that the motors were  able to spin them.

      Because the motors that we had at our disposal were under powered we were again confronted with another problem. It was hard to decide whether or not to order new motors from amazon prime, or if we should wait another week for our motors to arrive from the infamous banggood.com. We decided that it would be best to order new motors from amazon prime because, the infamous banggood.com had disappointed us before.

      As the trimester becomes closer and closer to ending, it seems we have bitten off more than we can chew. Our goal for next week is to finish the hardware on our quadcopter so that we can begin bug-testing for the next couple of weeks. It will not be easy to finish our quadcopter before the end of the trimester, however I am confident that we can do it. With a team of geniuses such as ours, there is nothing we can't accomplish. now, though, Lucas and I will continue to teach the 21 students who have joined us in this year’s XV. We hope you’ll enjoy learning all about their endeavors.
