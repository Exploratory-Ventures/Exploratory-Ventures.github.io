Our group, Mecanum Carduino, is making steady progress for our project. We have had quite a bit of down time, where we make updates to code, design, et cetera. We have not been able to construct the car yet, because we have had problems with our motors. The motors provided with the project did not fit the wheels we got, so we had to upgrade our motors. We are very close to moving into the construction phase of our project. We anticipate that this will happen within the next week.
<p>We have finished the autonomy code, and we are very close to being able to test it. We had a long delay when we were unable to test it because of the motor situation. Now that we have received our motors, all we have to do before we are able to test the code is solder the ultrasound sensor wires to the motor shield. We have one group member who is really good at soldering, but, unfortunately, he (Jeff) hasn’t been in class the past couple of days, and we don’t want to risk damaging the motor shield with bad soldering. Once we have the ultrasound sensors soldered, we will be able to test the code.<p>One of the major benefits of shifting the class style to one focused on multiple group projects is that it allows students to customize their experiences to their individual needs and interests while still learning to work in a group. It’s clear that many of the students have greatly enjoyed this very unique opportunity.
<p>Our group is feeling very solid about our progress. Our progress would go faster if our final group member were here more often. Jessie said, “I think we could be done by the end of next week, if only Jeff showed up every once in a while. He’s the one who knows how to solder, and how to set up the solar panels.” Nevertheless, we anticipate that we will be done in two weeks. Once we have the Carduino completely built, it will be smooth sailing from there on out, just fixing any bugs that may arise.

<p>The main problem that has been hindering our progress has been our wheels. They have caused most of the obstacles in our project. The have forced us to order new motors, material for the shaft, and a new motor shield, which we must solder to because it doesn’t have a female wire connecter. Luckily we have overcome most of these obstacles. Still, the motors have created even more obstacles, because now we have to figure out how to mount the motors to the wooden board. Jeff said, “It’s like a Hydra. When you solve one problem, two more pop up in its place.” </p></p></p>	</section>
