	Amount asking for. GIVE SHIPPING AMOUNTS TOO. Keep in mind quantities, shipping times, and death dooms.
	Reliability. Story from last year (the dish from the company that got 1 star)

Detailed Plan:
	LIST RESOURCES YOU PLAN TO USE. You are more likely to get an "A" if your idea is CREATIVE, HOWEVER it is very important to find and list resources that are available to you. If you see an ehow that seems like it will help, tell us.
	Forseen difficulties
	Skills used.
	Skills learned.
	Time used.
	People involved.
