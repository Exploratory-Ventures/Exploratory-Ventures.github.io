							<h2>Blog Post: Patricia and Lucas<br />


							</h2>


						</header>


						<p>







Despite what our week 8 blog post read, we are swapping what will be happening this week and next week. This week will be more focused on the GPS of the Arduino, which will be primarily worked on by Jack and Brian. Next week, week 10, will be focused on vocal and phonetic sounds that will be produced. One difficulty that I am currently facing is not knowing how I can help the group when everyone is working. We currently only have 1 or 2 jobs, but five people. However, this is being resolved as I spent the week morally supporting my group and writing the blog post. Nikolai has been sick and not at school very much, so he hasn’t been able to help very much. <p> Brian and Jack have been programming and working with the Arduino all week, and have completed the GPS part of the car. It can now sense where objects are in front of it, as well as where the arduino is going to go. They learned how the basic GPS function works on the arduino. The GPS has really taken up most of our time this week and not much else has happened. Alex and I worked a bit more with finalizing our gears and shapes on Tinkercad. “We are working to amplify the speaker so that we can get the arduino to say words and beep alot” says group member Brian. “We got the GPS working, so we can now monitor what time it is, the location, the speed, direction, and altitude; all with the arduino” said Jack. <p> In the future we will be finalizing the arduino, as time is quickly running out. However, all group members are certain that we will complete the arduino in time, and it will function at 100%.
